### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile ::octo:: .

My name is Mick, and I'm a hands-on software architect who's passionate about learning evermore about fostering and enabling high-performing teams.  The research from [DORA](https://bit.ly/dora-bfd) resonates deeply with me based on my first-hand background in production manufacturing ranging from physical product manufacturing at La-Z-Boy to the Reusable Solid Rocket (RSRM) boosters used by the Space Shuttle at NASA and the Space Shuttle.  

The insights from DORA and the data-backed principles are critical to guiding technologists in our relativly young industry.  Using data-driven learnings, we must continually iterate on further evolution and discovery through the _turning Point_ of the [Age of Software](https://www.tasktop.com/blog/covid-19-triggered-the-turning-point) and _Digital Disruption_.  Our collective engineering practices must ever-improve, not just to keep up with the pace of rapid technological change, but to continuously server, deliver, and ultimatly delight our customers.
