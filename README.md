### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile.

My name is Mick and I'm a hands-on technologist who's passionate about learning evermore to foster and enable high-performing teams. 

The research from [DORA](https://bit.ly/dora-bfd) resonates deeply with me based on my first-hand background in production manufacturing and from the various training and exposures to the practices of Lean principles.  Much of the learning and ways of working from Lean are whatâ€™s applied from modern DevOps, which focuses on end-to-end positive business outcomes over local optimizations.  

I've been fortunate to see such principles applied in several industries: physical product manufacturing - resulting in cheaper and faster lead times, life sciences and medical - where eliminating errors and waste isn't just better efficiencies but manifests life-saving results, and within programs that are literally out of this world, utilized by our nation's space and ballistic missile programs.

It's exciting to see how many ways industries of all shapes and sizes benefit from such simple ways of working and consider how employing these techniques and the capabilities outlined by [DORA](https://bit.ly/dora-bfd) formalizes software development into a proper [modern engineering](https://www.davefarley.net/?p=352) discipline.
