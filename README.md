### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile ::octo:: .

My name is Mick, and I'm a hands-on software architect who's passionate about learning evermore about fostering and enabling high-performing teams.  The research from [DORA](https://bit.ly/dora-bfd) resonates deeply with me based on my first-hand background in production manufacturing and from the various training and exposures to the practices of Lean.  

I've been fortunate to see these benefits ranging from physical product manufacturing, in the life sciences and medical industries where eliminating errors isn't just better efficiencies but real life-saving results; lastly, on programs that are out of this world, being utilized by our nation's space and ballistic missile programs. 

It's exciting to see how much is applicable to technology and consider how employing these techniques formalize software development into a proper [modern engineering discipline](https://www.davefarley.net/?p=352).
